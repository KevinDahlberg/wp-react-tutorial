Tutorial on setting up React to work within Wordpress.

## Technology Used

## Getting Started

All of the sample code is in the repository.  You can follow the tutorial, or you can download the code and play with it.  This isn't a full theme, just a setup that allows you to build with React within Wordpress.

## Introduction

One of the things I like to do is mash things together that aren't necessarily made to go together.  And, since I've spent most of this summer working with Wordpress, I've done a lot of combining with technologies I either know or am working on with Wordpress.  Not because I should, but because I can

### Why React?

I'm not the genius who decided that Wordpress and React should go with each other.  That's up to those guys at Automattic - the "business" side of Wordpress.  They've already put together this thing called Calypso that, for some reason, combines Wordpress with React.  

People way smarter than me have made this decision.  And as I play around with React, the more I am inclined to agree with them.  It's a lightweight library that is pretty powerful.  What it doesn't have is the full functionality of a framework like Angular.  Working with Wordpress, that's a good thing.  What React does is give you a powerful way to do cool stuff with the DOM, while choosing whether or not you want to add any extra stuff, such as Redux.

The other thing that helped push this evolution along was the Wordpress REST API.  If you are unfamiliar with the REST API, it allows developers to pull from the Wordpress backend while having a front end of their choosing.  This opens the door to any front end technology you want.
